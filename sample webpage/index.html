                <p>
                    The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language 
                    for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be 
                    assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and 
                    scripting languages such as JavaScript. Web browsers receive HTML 
                    documents from a web server or from local storage and render the 
                    documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of 
                    a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance 
                    of the document.

                <h3>C Programming</h3>
                <p>
                    C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting 
                    structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static 
                    type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical 
                    machine instructions. It has found lasting use in applications previously 
                    coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and 
                    various application software for computer architectures that range from 
                    supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.

                <div id="java">
                    <p>
                        Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that 
                        is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a 
                        general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, 
                        run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms 
                        that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are 
                        typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) 
                        regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
